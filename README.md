# gpp-handler README

Makes compiling with g++ easier by adding simple GUI. Works only for simple, one input file programs.

## Features

Compile your code with a click of a button.

## Requirements

You have to have a [g++ compiler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) installed.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `gpp-handler.autorun`: specifies if the compiled code should run automatically
- `gpp-handler.outputfilename`: the name of the output file; set to null to be the same as the source file name
- `gpp-handler.compilerpath`: the path to the g++ compiler; set to null if you have g++ path added to PATH

## Release Notes

Probably only one of them.

### 1.0.0

Initial release.

### 1.0.1

Bugfix lol.

**Enjoy!**
